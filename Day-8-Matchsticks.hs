-- Part 1
-- Text editor solution, using find and replace, multiple cursors, and a character counter: The untouched input has 6789 characters of code. (this includes newlines but that shouldn't matter for the purposes of our calculation.) Now use text editor trickery to remove the double quotes from the beggining and end of every line, replace \\ with a, \" with a, and \xab with b (for any characters a and b). For a new total of 5418 characters. So a difference of 1371. Note that replacing with a non special character like a was a concious choice, otherwise you can introduce unintended new escapes sequences.

Part 1
Text editor solution, using find and replace, multiple cursors, and a character counter.

The untouched input has 6789 characters of code. (this includes newlines but that shouldn't matter for the purposes of our calculation.) Now use text editor trickery to remove the double quotes from the beginning and end of every line, replace \\ with a, \" with a, and \xab with b (for any characters a and b). For a new total of 5418 characters. So a difference of 1371. Note that replacing with a non special character like a was a conscious choice, otherwise you can introduce unintended new escapes sequences.

Part 2
Another text editor solution using the same tools as above.

Again we start with 6789 characters of code. Replace each " and \ with aa (as each takes 2 characters to encode.) Finally add quotes to the beginning and end of every line. This leaves us with 8906 characters, for a difference of 2117
